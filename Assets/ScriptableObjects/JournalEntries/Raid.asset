  contents: "-My base was attacked by strange monsters today. They looked similar
    to those spherical creatures that were interested in my base. Seems they have
    the intelligence to coordinate attacks together. I think it\u2019s safe to assume
    they\u2019ve settled down somewhere around this area. I might be able to put
    a stop to this. In the meantime I should upgrade my base\u2019s defenses. They
    will surely come back stronger another day."
