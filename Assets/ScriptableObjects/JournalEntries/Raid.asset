  contents: -An attack was launched on my base today. Those FILTHY PARASITES tried
    wrecking my stuff! What is wrong with them??? I wonder where they plot their
    attacks from? There must be some sort of hub where they all reside. I'm sure
    they'll be back stronger another day, so I must make sure I am ready for any
    surprise.
