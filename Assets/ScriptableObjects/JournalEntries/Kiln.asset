  contents: -I've established a clay kiln! I can place burnable fuels in it and smelt
    metal into more pure forms. However, I'll need bellows to get my kiln hot enough
    to melt copper. I can convert my logs into charcoal if I cover the hole with
    a lump of clay. Charcoal will be useful since it burns hotter and longer.
